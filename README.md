The purpose of **WebEasyEventSourcing** is to showcase a working Web Application with implemented business rules, built using an event sourcing architecture. 

This showcase builds on SneakyPeet's original work on [EasyEventSourcing](https://github.com/SneakyPeet/EasyEventSourcing) by adding:
*Dependency Injection via Autofac
*Web Api for application interaction (Swagger UI as the default home page)

Like the original EasyEventSourcing, WebEasyEventSourcing also uses an in memory event store.
