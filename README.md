The purpose of **WebEasyEventSourcing** is to showcase a working Web Application with implemented business rules, built using an event sourcing architecture. 

This showcase builds on SneakyPeet's original work on [EasyEventSourcing](https://github.com/SneakyPeet/EasyEventSourcing) by adding:

* Dependency injection via [Autofac](http://autofac.org/)
* Web api for application interaction ([Swagger UI](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) as the default startup home page)

Like the original *EasyEventSourcing*, *WebEasyEventSourcing* also uses an in memory event store.
